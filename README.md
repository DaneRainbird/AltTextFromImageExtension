# Image Alt-Text Copier Extension
A simple Firefox Extension that adds a context menu for images to allow for easier copying of the alt-text. 

# Background
The idea for this came from [a post made by my friend Glitch](https://infosec.exchange/@glitchbun@tech.lgbt/109541445335245624), and it got me thinking - it's genuinely surprising that no browser (that I am aware of, at least!) has this function by default.

As such, this extension adds an item to the context menu for images that allows you to easily copy the alt-text, without needing to manually type it out or use the browser developer tools.

# Installing
Simply navigate to the [Firefox Addons Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-alt-text-copier/) and install!
